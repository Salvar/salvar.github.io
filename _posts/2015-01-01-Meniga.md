At Meniga -- an Icelandic fintech startup -- I was a member of a two-person "idea team", whose job was to design and prototype products that the sales team had already sold but did not exist yet. One of them was a twist on our personal finance management software, but for small businesses.

Initial sketches after interviewing a few business owners:

Later in the process, i.e. a couple of weeks later, some higher fidelity prototypes:
