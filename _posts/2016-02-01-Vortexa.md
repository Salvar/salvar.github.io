I joined Vortexa in the very early stages as employee #2, and moved to London for the opportunity. The idea: Create an analytics platform that tracks every single oil tanker in the world and uses machine learning to model past, present and future flows of oil globally. In real-time.

My role as Head of Product was to turn the founder's idea into a fully designed product concept using everything I knew about product design, UX research, UI design and prototyping. And then direct the development team to make sure the product vision makes it all the way to launch.

Some very early experiments while looking for the right idea:

Lots of whiteboard thinking:

And finally, the image from above explained: One billion location updates from oil tankers that draw an amazing picture of the world. Once I found the right parameters it took our beefy server a week to generate the tiles:
