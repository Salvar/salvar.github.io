I joined Vortexa in the very early stages as employee #2, and moved to London for the opportunity. The idea: Create an analytics platform that tracks every single oil tanker in the world and uses machine learning to model past, present and future flows of oil globally. In real-time.

My role was to turn the founder's idea into a fully designed product concept using everything I knew about product design, UX research, UI design and prototyping.

Some very early experiments looking for the right track:
