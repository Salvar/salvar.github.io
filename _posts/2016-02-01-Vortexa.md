I joined Vortexa in the very early stages as employee #2, and moved to London for the opportunity. The idea: Create an analytics platform that tracks every single oil tanker in the world and uses machine learning to model past, present and future flows of oil globally. In real-time.

My role as Head of Product was to turn the founder's idea into a fully designed product concept using everything I knew about product design, UX research, UI design and prototyping. And then direct the development team to make sure the product vision makes it all the way to launch.

Some very early experiments while looking for the right idea:

Lots of whiteboard thinking:

Here's an animation of a prototype displaying the crossfiltering concept I wanted to be central to all filtering interactions:

A part of my job was to design how to split the world up into arbitrary regions of GeoJSON polygons. The solution: A geospatial polygon classification graph in GraphML:

Here's a union of all GeoJSON polygons, covering every country that touches the ocean or inland seas:

Another part of my job was fine-tuning the results of our algorithms that scanned the globe for movement patterns to find areas of interest. The three circles in the ocean are tell-tale signs of oil platforms:

Sometimes design helps to clarify and visualize problems, like how to log a complex series of ship-to-ship transfers as discrete cargo movements:

Or how our vessel size classification compares to industry standards:

I also did whatever design was needed, including the conference stand we used at our launch event at the Financial Times Commodities Summit in Lausanne, Switzerland:

And designed marketing documents, e.g. brochures and infographics:

And finally, the image from above explained: One billion location updates from oil tankers that draw an amazing picture of the world. Once I found the right parameters it took our beefy server a week to generate the tiles:
